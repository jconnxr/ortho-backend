# OrthoGPT Backend Setup Instructions

## STEP 1: Ask John to Send You the Backend Folder

Make sure he sends you the full `OrthoGPT_Backend/` folder with:

- `app.py`
- `requirements.txt`
- Any subfolders (like `/utils/`, `/routes/`, etc.)
- His local `.env` file (optional, for API keys)
- `__init__.py` if using Flask in modular format

### Preferred method: Push to GitHub  
### Alternative: Send as a `.zip`
